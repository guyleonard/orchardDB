Due to JGI's insistence of your acceptance of their Data Distribution policy, the user will have to retreive these data manually. Methods to do this will be outlined below.

## Genome Portal

## Phytozome v10.2

# Notes
## Preferred Portal/Assembly
Quite often one taxa will be available from many of the sources therefore it is important to decide which version to use in this database for accountability.

To do this I have decided upon two criteria:
 1 How easy is it to obtain the predicted proteins?
 2 What is the original source of the predicted proteins?

For example:
 1 If the genome is in NCBI then it is very easy to download, let's do that.
 2 If the genome is in JGI but originates from BROAD, let's take the original, unless 1.

At all points I will maintain the spreadsheet to indicate the prefered source. If you prefer a particular source, then you may "swap" out the genome's predicted proteins as you like, I am not suggesting that my preference is correct or best.
