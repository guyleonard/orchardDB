# orchardDB
A set of publicly available amino acid sequences from various genome portals and projects for use with the Orchard pipeline.

This will pull the predicted proteomes of completed and draft genomes from NCBI, JGI, BROAD and several other genome portal resources and format them to be compatible with the Orchard Pipeline.
